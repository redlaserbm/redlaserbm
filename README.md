## Hi there 👋

- Mathematics Ph.D. (Florida State University, May 2023) My dissertation concerned modelling insider trading in the stock market using a continuous time Kyle-Back model with stochastic liquidity.
- Full-stack programmer (Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Typescript, Node, Flask, FastAPI, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) seeking full-time work in the discipline.
- Art and music enthusiast.
- I made some [cool video games](https://redlaserbm.itch.io/) in my free time.

Note: I also own the account [bmostowski1996](https://github.com/bmostowski1996) which I intend to merge with this one in August.
